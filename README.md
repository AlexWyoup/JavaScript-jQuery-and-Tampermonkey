# JavaScript, jQuery, and Tampermonkey Scripts
These are various scripts I've written for personal use, demonstration purposes (i.e. via my YouTube channel), friends, etc. Brief descriptions for each can be found below.

**[Fast GitHub Repo Delete.js](https://github.com/dsasmblr/JavaScript-jQuery-and-Tampermonkey/blob/master/scripts/Fast%20GitHub%20Repo%20Delete.js)** - ***(JavaScript)*** | *A work-in-progress script that currently adds a delete button to a user's GitHub repositories main page, then fast-deletes any given repo after its delete button has been clicked 5 times! Great for use via Tampermonkey, or can be ran from the console while on the repositories page.*

**Napalm FTP Indexer.js** - ***(jQuery / Tampermonkey)*** | *This is an extensive script that modifies searchftps.net to do a number of things, including remove ads, make requests to the server with hash information to obtain links with which I repurpose download buttons on search results pages, and more!*

**CompleteROMs.com.js** - ***(jQuery / Tampermonkey)*** | *Modifies completeroms.com to remove tricky iframes and ads. Also finds download functionality and overrides time-related enabled/disabled status. This script was used in [a YouTube video of mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxpm_wrCm7M) to teach viewers about fun ways to use Chrome DevTools, jQuery, and Tampermonkey!*

**NewGrounds.com - My Friend Pedro.js** - ***(jQuery / Tampermonkey)*** | *Modifies the "My Friend Pedro" game page on NewGrounds. This script was used in [a YouTube video of mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18ciaTi4oA) to teach viewers more about using Chrome DevTools, jQuery, and Tampermonkey to hack around with a site!*

**Reddit NSFW Saved Post Scrubber** - ***(jQuery)*** | *Gets all saved posts and populates them on one page, then unsaves all saved NSFW posts. One thing to be fixed is that the script currently runs synchronously, so the browser will hang until the script is completed.*
